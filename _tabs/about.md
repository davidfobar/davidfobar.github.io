**Monospace Adventures** is a personal project log meant first and foremost for my future self. It exists to document ideas, experiments, and builds while they are still in progress—not just after they succeed.

This blog is an attempt to stay accountable by deliberately working on a smaller, more focused set of projects and recording steady progress over time. Notes here may be incomplete, imperfect, or exploratory by design. The goal is clarity and continuity rather than polish.

If this archive proves useful to anyone else along the way, that’s a bonus—but its primary function is to serve as a record of what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and why.
