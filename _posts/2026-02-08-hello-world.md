This is my first attempt at using a blog to organize my projects. For too long, I have been inspired to try a new project, invested time and money into it, and then lost focus along the way—only for the next shiny project to present itself.

The aim of this blog is primarily to help me document things for myself. If this happens to help someone else eventually, that is great, but it is not the purpose.

So here it is: the first blog post. 

### Active personal projects: (As of 08FEB2026)

- Custom Moveo 6-DoF robot arm firmware using a BigTreeTech Octopus (STM32F446)
- Celestial Sync – a harmonic drive telescope mount
- Astrophotography
- Workspace organization
- Strongman equipment
- Painting miniatures for tabletop gaming
- And now, this blog

### Projects left in the past

- 1986 Ford Mustang with heavy modifications
- Hexapod robot
- Large-format CoreXY 3D printer
- CNC plasma table

### Finished projects I am happy to claim

- Computer speakers (Overnight Sensations)
- Living room surround sound speakers, including a pillar subwoofer
- Flatbed for my truck
- Rebuild of a truck engine (6.0L Powerstroke)
- Modern brakes on a classic car
- Complete kitchen remodel, including custom-built cabinets and a concrete countertop
- Trailer smoker (BBQ)

I look forward to adding to this list. For now, the next step is to define objectives for my active projects and continue updating this blog with progress and details.
